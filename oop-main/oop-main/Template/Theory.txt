Problem Statement
Write a function template selectionSort. Write a program that inputs, sorts and outputs an int array and a float array.
Objectives:
To learn the use of Templates and sorting in c++ programming

Outcomes:
The performer will be able to design a program in c++ using Templates and Sorting .

Software Requirements:
1. 64-bit Open source Linux or its derivative
2. Open Source C++ Programming tool like G++/GCC.

Theory:
Templates
Templates are the foundation of generic programming, which involves writing code in a way that is independent of
any particular type.
A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function. The library containers like iterators and
algorithms are examples of generic programming and have been developed using template concept.

Just as we can define function templates, we can also define class templates. The general form of a generic class declarationis shown here:
template <class type> class class-name {
Here, type is the placeholder type name, which will be specified when a class is instantiated. You can define more
than one generic data type by using a comma-separated list.

Algorithm:
1. Create Template template <typename T>
2.Create a function to perform sorting.
void Sort(T* const array,int size){
3.Create a function to display array
void printarray(T* const array,int size
